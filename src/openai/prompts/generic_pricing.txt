Good [current time of day EST, either "morning", "afternoon", or "evening"] [sender's name], we would love to help you out! Our pricing is based on volume, so how much space is taken up in the back of our truck is what we charge. We have a 16-foot boxtruck and to fill it up all the way full is $1235 but then we have 12 different price points starting at a $129 minimum. I can send our crew out to give you a free estimate. If you like the price, they can knock it out right then and there!
